    My name is Mahsa Sadeghpour . <br>
    Before I applied for this program, I studied civil engineering for a year and a half. During that time, I realized I didn't like that major, so I quit and searched for a major I truly enjoyed. I settled on industrial design and studied it for four years. I loved that major, but I understood that it might not fulfill me completely, and I needed something to keep up with the world.Initially, I wanted to pursue interactive media design, but I realized I needed a broader skill set. I aspire to apply creativity in situations beyond the front-end, comprehending all aspects of a project.. So, I decided to focus on web development and internet applications. To make sure I really liked this major, I took some courses, and now, here I am in web development and internet applications. I hope to successfully complete this course and achieve my dreams and goals .
